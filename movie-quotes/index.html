        <p> <em> [Verse 1] </em></p>
            <p>I am unwritten</p>
            <p>Can't read my mind</p>
            <p>I'm undefined</p>
            <p>I'm just beginning</p>
            <p>The pen's in my hand</p>
            <p>Ending unplanned</p>



        <p> <em> [Pre-Chorus] </em></p>
            <p>Staring at the blank page before you</p>
            <p>Open up the dirty window</p>
            <p>Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find</p>
            <p>Reaching for something in the distance</p>
            <p>So close you can almost taste it</p>
            <p>Release your inhibitions</p>



        <p> <em> [Chorus] </em></p>
            <p>Feel the rain on your skin</p>
            <p>No one else can feel it for you</p>
            <p>Only you can let it in</p>
            <p>No one else, no one else</p>
            <p>Can speak the words on your lips</p>
            <p>Drench yourself in words unspoken</p>
            <p>Live your life with arms wide open</p>
            <p>Today is where your book begins</p>
            <p>The rest is still unwritten</p>
            <p>Oh, oh, oh</p>



        <p> <em> [Verse 2] </em></p>
            <p>I break tradition</p>
            <p>Sometimes my tries are outside the lines</p>
            <p>We've been conditioned to not make mistakes</p>
            <p>But I can't live that way</p>
