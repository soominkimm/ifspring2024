        <h2> <em>Description:</em> </h2>
        <p>When you have overripe bananas laying around at home, the usual go-to thought is to make banana bread. Not only is it easy to make, but it is also makes for a delicious snack. Another plus is that this is something that you can easily share the love with others.</p>
        
        <h2> <em>Ingredients:</em> </h2>
        <ul>
        <li>2 cups (250g) all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (8Tbsp;113g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
        <li>3/4 cup (150g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
        <li>1/3 cup (80g) plain yogurt or sour cream, at room temperature</li>
        <li>2 cups (460g) mashed bananas (about 4 large ripe bananas)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li> <em>*Personal addition: Maple Syrup (as much as you want)*</em> </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2> <em>Instructions:</em> </h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with nonstick spray.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon together.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, use any type of mixer with a paddle or whisk (or even by hand is fine) to beat together the butter and brown sugar together until the texture is smooth and creamy. Then, add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Then, beat in the yogurt, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract until combined.</li>
        <li>Add wet ingredients to dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Do not overmix.</li>
        <li>Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan and bake for 60-65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for an hour. Finally, remove the bread from the pan and cool directly on a wire rack until ready to serve. </li>
        </ol>

        <h2> <em>Recipe Websites:</em> </h2>
        <p class="link"><a href="https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/best-banana-bread-recipe/">Sally's Baking Addiction</a> - This website is my go-to website for most baking recipes. Sally gives us clear instructions in a type of wording that makes the viewers want to bake more. The recipes are also not hard to follow in general, which helps with the most important element when it comes to cooking and baking: the ability to follow instructions.</p>
        <p class="link"><a href="https://www.marthastewart.com/312772/banana-bread">Martha Stewart</a> - What I appreciate the most about this website is that it has pictures for almost every step of the recipe. It's rare to find a website with such an organized layout when it comes to visually representing every step, as that is a lot of work. However, especially for the banana bread, Martha also includes a video that makes this recipe extremely easy to follow and very attractive to viewers. One thing I do not enjoy about this website is that the organization of the ingredients is not effective; there are no blocked out sections to indicate whether the recipe is over or not.</p>
        <p class="link"><a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/one-bowl-gluten-free-banana-bread/">Minimalist Baker</a> - I definitely think that this website displays less creativity when it comes to the design of the website. However, what it does well is the concise wording of the directions, along with the clean execution of the summary of the recipe and instructions at the bottom of the page. Also, I wanted to include a link to a recipe that provides the gluten-free option!</p>

        <h2> <em>Non-Recipe Websites for Inspiration:</em> </h2>
        <p class="link"><a href="https://www.kismetla.com/">Kismet</a> - This was one of the websites that popped up when I searched for inspirational designs. Considering that it is a website for a restaurant, I love the colorway that the website employs, along with the captviating visual elements. I also like the running bar at the bottom of the website.</p>
        <p class="link"><a href="https://www.wenxinwendyju.com/">Wendy Ju's website</a> - This is a personal website and not commercial, yet it is so well-organized and follows a certain aesthetic. I appreciate websites that efficiently organize a lot of information that usually would be hard for a viewer to take in. What was also the most interesting/peculiar about this website is the red, round cursor!</p>
        <p class="link"><a href="https://abduzeedo.com/">Abduzeedo</a> - Minimalism + Pops of color = how I would define this website. The squares help with visual organization, even when the designs that are encompassing the squares are full of vibrance. I also enjoy the numbering element below each of the squares, along with how information is categorized on the left bar by various classifications.</p>
