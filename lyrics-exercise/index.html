        <p> <em> [Verse 1] </em></p>
            I am unwritten
            Can't read my mind
            I'm undefined
            I'm just beginning
            The pen's in my hand
            Ending unplanned



        <p> <em> [Pre-Chorus] </em></p>
            Staring at the blank page before you
            Open up the dirty window
            Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find
            Reaching for something in the distance
            So close you can almost taste it
            Release your inhibitions



        <p> <em> [Chorus] </em></p>
            Feel the rain on your skin
            No one else can feel it for you
            Only you can let it in
            No one else, no one else
            Can speak the words on your lips
            Drench yourself in words unspoken
            Live your life with arms wide open
            Today is where your book begins
            The rest is still unwritten
            Oh, oh, oh



        <p> <em> [Verse 2] </em></p>
        I break tradition
        Sometimes my tries are outside the lines
        We've been conditioned to not make mistakes
        But I can't live that way

        The rest is still unwritten
        The rest is still unwritten
        Oh, yeah, yeah
