        <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
        
        <p>1. Provide your name, major, year in school (sophomore, junior, etc).</p>
            <p>My name is Soomin Kim. I am a junior double majoring in Design and PNP, which is Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology.</p>
        <p>2. Tell us a bit about your background and what prompted you to take this class.</p>
            <p>I have always been interested in learning how to code and deal with front-end developing, as a lot of my friends around me are Computer Science majors or have HCI minors! I also think that coding is quite literally integrated everywhere. Therefore, this class seemed like both a fun and educational experience.</p>
        <p>3. Do you have any experience with HTML/CSS/JS? If so, tell us a bit about it.</p>
            <p>I have zero expeirence with any of these!</p>
        <p>4. Name one thing you hope to learn in this class.</p>
            <p>One thing I hope to learn in this class is a basic skillset that can help me develop a foundation to web-design and how to work these programs that we are talking about.</p>
        <p>5. Name one way you expect designing for screen to be different from designing for paper.</p>
            <p>First, I think the most important difference is the language in which we use to design. On paper, we use apps like Phothsop and InDesign to create things. However, for designing for screen, we use these programs that enable us to code (super interesting)! I also think how I look at my design works and how I will be editing my work will differ compared to when I'm working by hand or on paper.</p>
        <p>6. Provide a link to a website you think exemplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</p>
            <p>I think the New Yorker's website works in an efficient manner to accomplish its goals of providing people with easy access to different news sectors. I also really like the designs the New Yorker employs in general, so I think that adds on to the attractiveness of this website for me. I also tend to enjoy clean designs for any art that I do,so this website really works for me!</p>

        <p>7. Provide a link to a website you think exmplifies effective communication. Explain your choice.</p>
            <p>I encountered this website by chance while searching for websites with cool designs that I could explore. I love the simplistic yet captivating element that this website contains. Even if it's displaying artworks or products that don't relate to each other, the play with color and basic figures to create a harmony on a webpage really amazed me.</p>

        <p>8. Provide a link to a website you think works well. Explain your choice.</p>
            <p>I wouldn't say that Headpsace's website is particularly visually interesting for me. However, I do think that it has a clear path that viewers can take so that people who are not familiar with using the web can also have easy access to all the resources that they provide. It also seems to entice viewers to want to sign up for the free trial because of how organized the website is as a whole.</p>
